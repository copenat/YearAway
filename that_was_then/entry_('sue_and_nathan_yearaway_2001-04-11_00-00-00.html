                We flew out of Bangkok on Saturday lunchtime in a super-dooper modern plane (Thai style!) with propellers.  It was a bit scary really, but we got here in one piece so propellers are okay after all!   We arrived in Koh Samui and it was HOT - really HOT.  In fact, it's taking a bit of getting used to at the moment and yesterday the electricity was down for the whole day so we really got a taste of the heat as there wasn't any cold water and worst of all there weren't any fans running.  Needless to say we did very little and dozed a lot on our veranda!<br>We're staying in a really cool place called 'Tamarind Retreat' - take a look on www.tamarindretreat.com, we've got the Tamarind Suite - open on all sides to the elements with no locks on the doors (which was a bit weird to get used to at first).  And, the piece de resistance - an outside bathroom surrounded by a very high wall so you do get some privacy.  It took a bit of getting used to - and the wildlife has taken even more getting used to!  It seems Gordon the Gecko, Larry the Lizard, numerous members of a mozzie family and some noisy frogs have taken a real liking to us!  It's right in the middle of a rainforest and our villa is surrounded by palm trees and butterflies and lots of nice things like that!<br>When we arrived at the Tamarind we were both a little worried as some guy in the airport told us that it was in a really noisy part of town - he couldn't have been more wrong, we are far away from everything which is perfect for the rest and rehab. we are both in much need of.<br>As part of the package we both got a free 'indulgence package' which was basically a full body massage (not quite everywhere - it wasn't one of those Thai massages!), a herbal steam and plunge pool and a facial for me and a back and shoulder massage for Nathan.  The massage was done in a huge wooden octagonal room on a hill, open all around and looking out to the forest.  We had our package at the end of the day so it was just getting dark and all the creatures were coming out and beginning to get really noisy - especially the cicadas (or enchiladas as Nathan likes to call them!) and the frogs.  It was lovely... nice peaceful music playing mmmmm...<br>Yesterday was my birthday and, after a birthday coconut for breakfast and a birthday cake for lunch, we went out in to Chaweng in the evening for a special birthday supper at the Betelnut Restaurant.  (notice how my birthday seems to have revolved around food?)  The place wasn't exactly Thai - in fact it was run by a guy from California called Jeffrey - it was fusion food (what exactly does that mean?) and was scrummy!  We had our first taste of local transport on the way home when we came back in a songthaew - the guy was a nutter overtaking everything he could on every bend he could.  Oh well, guess we're in one piece still.  Anyway, that's it for now, off for a foot massage and then dinner on the beach watching the sunset.
