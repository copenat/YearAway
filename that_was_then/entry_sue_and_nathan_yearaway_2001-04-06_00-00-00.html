                Arrived in Bangkok - only just though - we got a little caught up in the airport and only just managed to get on the plane.  Needless to say we were rather hot and bothered by the time we did get on!<BR> Not much to say really except that we're here and it's DAMN hot (36 degrees).  We're staying at a hotel right next to the airport, so it's noisy as well as hot, but WE'RE HERE!  <br>
