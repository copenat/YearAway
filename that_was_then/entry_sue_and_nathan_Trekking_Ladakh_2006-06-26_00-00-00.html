                So after three and a half years we are on the move again. The plans have been made, the gear has been bought, the training has gone well (despite a few back problems) - so we have commenced the packing of boxes. We fly to India in 2 weeks time to see the Himalayas close up. Some people have asked us why we aren't content to see the Himalayas from a distance (like from a warm Goan beach) or buy a nice picture book or watch a National Geographic film. Well, some things you just have to see in person I reckon!
