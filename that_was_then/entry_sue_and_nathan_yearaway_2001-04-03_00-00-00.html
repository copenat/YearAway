                Well, Saturday was the wedding and everything went really well, but it was all extremely nerve-racking.  Neither of us heard much of the ceremony because we were so nervous!  There were plenty of tears, lots of champagne and heaps of very good food so we were happy!  Feels a little weird to Mr and Mrs Cope though!<br>Anyway - tomorrow we fly out to Thailand.  Still can't quite get our heads round the idea that we're actually going and that the planning bit is over, but we are and it is!  So, the next time you hear from us we'll be in Koh Samui enjoying a bit of luxury - can you believe that?!<br><br>
